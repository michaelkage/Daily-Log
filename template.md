### The Strategy for Today
Every time you finish a session, you just copy the text from `template.md`, hit the "Add File" button in your log, and paste it into a new entry. It keeps your "Green Squares" (GitHub contribution graph) stacking up, which is the ultimate proof of work on this platform.



### The "XP" Move
Check your profile page now. That new "System Traffic" badge should be ticking up every time you refresh. 

**Are you feeling the new badge, or do you want to try a "Percentage Bar" that shows how close you are to finishing your current project?**
